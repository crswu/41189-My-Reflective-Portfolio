## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
Learnt about the definitions and attributes of a system aswel as complex systems

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I didn't know the types of systems such as complex, complicated, chaotic and obvious systems.

### What insights have I gained?
I never knew that systems especially complex had a lot more depth to it as well as its steps within the characteristics of a complex system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I've noticed that when its a lot easier to learn about the different systems when they are compared against eachother. My weakness is that I tend to lose focus too easily half way in the workshop.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
It was hard to stay focused during class towards the end but communicating with my team during the workshop helped me stay on task as if they ask a question I want to be able to help them.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would need to remove all my distractions within my room so that I won't lose focus.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the uses of modelling and how they can help give us a better understanding of the problems of complex adaptive systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I did not know that all models are wrong and that many are useful.

### What insights have I gained?
That there are many different ways to use models in similar situations rather than one staple pathway. Since highschool I really enjoyed math because it was a subject that always just required to find the formula (pathway) and just plug the formula into the question but now I notice that subjects like 41189 aren't as simple and can have multiple answers.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My weakness is that when I see the topic as something I have learnt about before such as models I tend to get overly confident and zone out often but this always comes back to bite as it is a lot more complex than I imagined. My strength is acknowledging this bad behaviour and trying to learn from my mistake.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The only challenge I faced this week was to stay on track of the content but was easily fixed after my realisation for the depth of content.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To never underestimate a topic so that I won't fall behind on any topic

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the Shapely and LOTB value

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Rules of thumb often outperform the most sophisticated strategies

### What insights have I gained?
That there is numerical value when calculating an individual's value.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I noticed that when there are math formulas I feel more confident but at the same time if there is a new math symbol that I am unaware of it takes some time to wrap my head around it.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I struggled to understand what certain symbols meant in the Shapely value but it was quickly solved after asking my group members for help.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To do better next time I should look into next weeks topics beforehand so that I will have a general understanding before the workshop.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A
