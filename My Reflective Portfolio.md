## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
Learnt about the definitions and attributes of a system aswel as complex systems

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I didn't know the types of systems such as complex, complicated, chaotic and obvious systems.

### What insights have I gained?
I never knew that systems especially complex had a lot more depth to it as well as its steps within the characteristics of a complex system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I've noticed that when its a lot easier to learn about the different systems when they are compared against eachother. My weakness is that I tend to lose focus too easily half way in the workshop.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
It was hard to stay focused during class towards the end but communicating with my team during the workshop helped me stay on task as if they ask a question I want to be able to help them.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would need to remove all my distractions within my room so that I won't lose focus.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A
