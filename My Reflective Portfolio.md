# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio


## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
During this week I learnt about the definitions and attributes of a system aswel as complex systems. After this week I know that complex systems are also known as complicated systems that have many parts. Systems such as the economy can also be labelled as complex systems and are also said to have dynamic complexity. Although complex systems can be labelled as 'complicated' there is actually a lot of difference as complex is usually very hard to predict with the outcome unknown versus complicated where the outcome is usually pre-determined already.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before this week I did not know a single thing about systems so concepts such as complex, complicated, chaotic and obvious systems are completely new. After the tutorial I realised that I am surrounded by all kinds of systems and I have been oblivious of this the whole time. I didn't know that systems could even be put into categories such as technical systems and social systems. I am now well aware of what classifies as a systems and will now be always conscious about it in my daily life. Although for complex systems it is something that can not always be seen with the eye; complex systems can have an unpredictable behaviour and will not be able to fully understand how it functions by just looking at its parts but instead will need to look outside the box and not just at the components of the system.

### What insights have I gained?
After the week 1 workshop although not very content heavy it provided me with various insights; without any realisation whether I wanted to or not I have and am always in a social system, every interaction I have will also be affecting this system. For my entirely life, I have been contributing to a social system so it was also an eye opener learning about the bases of a social system. What struck out to me was that some bases of the social systems included sanctions, ranks and goals.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
By the end of the workshop and reflecting after, i've noticed that it is a lot easier to learn about the different systems when compared to side by side. As it was only the first week it was not very content heavy so it's hard to analyse but I would say that my weakness is that when the topic is irrelevant to the subject my mind tends to drift off and lose focus so even if the topic relevant my mind is still not there and prepared to learn as much as before.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
For me personally this week, I found it hard to stay focused during class mid-way through the workshop but having a team with a group chat was extremely useful. Especially with this subject being an online course there is a lot of distractions in my room especially without supervision. Communicating with my team during the workshop helped me stay on task and if they asked any questions I would feel motivated to try to assist them which helped me stay on track with the content.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For the following week I would try to fix my habit of being distracted so I removed most of the possible distractions within my room as I do my work on the computer set in my room. Hopefully after all the removal I won't be able to fidget around during class and lose my focus essentially depriving myself of anything to do but focus on the computer screen in front of me.


## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
In week two I learnt about the general uses of modelling and how they are able to give us a better understanding of the problms in a complex adaptive system. It was also interesting to learn via real-life examples such as the beehive and standing ovations. This taught me to see the relevance and potential of the subject Human-Centred Complex Systems within futurue workfields. This week I have also realised the importance of models even in day to day life; it assists us to think in a clearer state, understand how to use the data and also figure out how to tackle on the situation at hand.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
After reflection of what I knew before this week and currently I had realised that I now know a lot more than before. I also learnt that there are many different ways to use models in similar situations rather than one staple pathway. Since highschool I really enjoyed math because it was a subject that always just required to find the formula (pathway) and just plug the formula into the question but now I notice that subjects like 41189 aren't as simple and can have multiple answers. The wisdom hierarchy was also something I never knew of until now; even with all the steps it consists I never expected that there would be a way to turn large volumes of data into wisdom.

### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection I have noticed this week that instead of other subjects that make us understand how certain models and diagrams work this subject has made me think more about why and what the model is actually providing me as a learner. Before instead of learning of the components of a model and just filling it in, I am more conscious of the reasoning on why these are the components of the model and what it is trying to assist in producing. The concept of wisdom of crows was also very intriguing and opened another path of thinking for me. Instead of one knowledgeable individual, groups of individuals are more likely capable when generating wisdom. This will change my outlook on universities always making assignments groupwork and each member should help multiply our knowledge to produce better results rather than the usual concept of just adding our answers together.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
One of my main weaknesses is that when I see the topic as something I have learnt about before such as models I tend to get overly confident and zone out often but after this week I realised that not all subjects are the same as this subject is a lot more complex than I imagined. Another core weakness that I have realised wast my mindset of groupwork; rather than thinking that the smartest member will produce the best and correct results, combining our knowledge together will produce a much stronger results. After a quick reflection of the entire week I noticed that I have an ability in pinpointing mistakes and bad habits even if it's my own which can positively impact my learning by fixing up these behaviours and try to replace it with much healthier habits.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As it was only the second week of the semester I could not get used to the 3 hour long workshops so I had struggled to stay focused during the workshop. It also proved difficult with the depth of content that was being taught only 2 weeks in but after realisation of the amount of content I tried even harder to stay focused and engaged. To improve this, as weeks go by I should be used to these 3 hour long workshops and will train to be able to stay focused in that duration.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
From next week onwards I should look at the content that will be taught in the workshops so I will know what and how much content I need to consume during the classes. If it is another content heavy week I would be able to prepare my mindset for a long and hard workshop.

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
Over the course of this week the main knowledge I have learned was to model how people behave. Models such as ration models, behavioural models and rule-based based are able to help us learn how they make decisions and reveal hidden information. These models essentially deconstruct the human psychological influences and predict the undetermined outcome. In terms of problem solving I have learnt that diversity in a group environment actually provides more to the group than following one's idea. Furthermore, I learnt that within a group environment for solving problem the steps go from Perspectives to Heuristics to Team diversity to Recombination to Innovation .

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before this week I did not know that problem solving in groups had a lot more depth than it does. Steps such as Heuristics to find how we find solutions to problem once we have framed it in a specific perspective and Recombination of others' perspectives and heuristics were very new concepts that never came to mind in problem solving as a group. Finally, for modelling purposes I learnt how to deconstruct and analyse human characterics. This newly gained ability will help create human-centred models that I never knew before. Additionally, the knowledge that rules of thumb often outperform the most sophisticated strategies was really

### What insights have I gained?
Upon reflecting this week's workshop there were parts of it that struck out to me; the knowledge that rules of thumb often outperform the most sophisticated strategies was shocking and makes me wonder if I have been making my life more complicated than it needs to. From just two weeks of content it has made me realise that within my surroundings there are a lot more systems and relationships interacting with eachother than I thought. Not only that but everything is a lot more complex that I imagined, the fact that the shapely value can be applied in cooperative games that I have partook several times in my life.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I believe that my strength is the adaptability to use what I have recently learnt into action as soon as possible; with a group project at hand instead of assigning a leader to the group I suggested that we all voice our own opinions so that we have more to build off from as learnt this week about team diversity. In doing so I also realised a weakness of mine which is the fear of social interactions. Although I want to voice my opinions in a group I can never get straight to the point as I am generally in fear of giving a bad impression to other members.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As mentioned above a reoccuring challenge I face is the inability to correctly voice my own opinion. Instead of getting straight to the point I generally take another path to deliver my opinion which may sometimes even not lead tot he same point I was trying to deliver. To help solve this problem I tried getting to know my group members more so that there wouldn't be any misconceived opinions of me later within the semester. Lastly, I struggled to understand what certain symbols meant in the Shapely value but it was quickly solved after asking my group members for help.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
As said in the previous weeks, I planned to look into the future week's content beforehand but if I ever encountered a hard topic that I couldnt consume I would just skip it and hope for the best in the next workshop. To do better next time instead of giving up after a glance of the upcoming workload I should either put more effort into understanding the context or ask my group members for their thoughts.

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the three models system dynamics, networks and agent-based models. These models will help in modelling complex adaptive systems in the future as features such as feedback are very valuable especially in modern problems. This was especially the case for system dynamics models as is it mainly based on feedback loops whether positive or negative. The pizza house example that was used to demonstrate system dynamics in action was also very knowledgeable to see and understand the perspectives of business owners and their options they have to decide on.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The three models of system dynamics, networks and agent-based models were new concepts to me that I did not know before aswel as how they can be applied to examples of the real life world. Prior to this week I have also realised the usefulness of models and how they are able to help prevent problems such as financial problems for businesses. Something I did not know before that also peaked my interest was the 6 degrees of separation in which no matter who we are or where we are we are only 6 steps away from any person across the globe. Especially in today's sociey of social media, there are a lot more connections which will decrease the average of steps between eachother.

### What insights have I gained?
All in all I primarily gained the sight of how there are not only so many different models that can be applied to certain scenarios but also that models have a lot more complexity and layers to it than meets the eye. Furthermore these models can be used in everyday scenarios and even have the ability to prevent or prepare for upcoming problems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection I have realised that through the videos and diagrams that I have seen it has definitely proven that I am a visual learner but at the same time the images can be misleading. For example, the purpose of the first system dynamics model gif within the week 4 module is confused me on what its purpose was. Another strength I have realised is that if a topic is rather interesting, I not only enjoy learning about these new topics but I am more engaged and eager to learn more about it.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As mentioned above there were a few images that caused me confused but after asking my group I received an explanation that helped wrap my head around it. Other than that there were not many challenges I had to face this week as the content was rather enjoyable and easy to understand.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In regards to the confusing images,next time I should communicate with my group/class more so that I do not get stuck on that section and potentially fall behind. To keep up the lack of challenges, I should try to engage more into the topics so that I can potentially take more interest in it making my learning experience a lot easier and smoother.


## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
In this week I was introduced to the concepts of Probability distributions, normal distributions and long-tailed distributions. Probability distributions is the distribution of values that random variable may have and represents the chance of finding the possible value of the random variable. For normal distributions, it is dependent on the mean and the standard deviation of the sample. Long-tailed distributions are used to portray large events that can occur with suffiecient probabilty to a degree worthy of being of concern.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
One of the core main things that I did not know before this workshop was that probability distributions can help model our world allowing us to obtain estimates of the probability for certain events that may occur. Another thing that I did not know before was that there were different types of random variables; discrete and continuous. Finally, the Central Limit Theorem was also a new concept to me and did not know the characteristics of it

### What insights have I gained?
Something that I will remember fromt his week is that long-tailed distributions should not be over-seen and have sufficient probability to be of concern. This insight has allowed me to realise the power of long-tailed distributions and its ability to assist and prepare for upcoming problems in the world. Finally, even though I had previously completed the course 'Introduction to Statistics' I realised that there are still a lot more to learn about common topics such as the bell curves and probabilities.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As this was the week was the final formation of the groups I realised that a strength of mine is the initiative I have in conversations which makes a healthy environment for a group chat allowing others to feel comfortable talking to the group aswel. However, after conversations I had realised a major weakness of mine which is to not worry about the assignment til the due date comes closer. This is a bad habit of mine that will eventually make the upcoming days towards the due date a lot more stressful not only on myself bu on the group. Another weakness that has been reoccurring is my ability to use github, it has been a slow process learning how to navigate through the system.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I had to face this week was the inability to navigate through the github system as I struggled to even find my own commits. However, my team set aside some time of their own to assist me and even taught me the basics of github.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To prevent any github navigation problems above I should pay more attention in class when the tutor is showing and explaining the uses of github. To fix up my bad habit of leaving the assignments til the last couple days or week I should assign weekly goals within the assignment to make sure that we are on task and more stress-free.


## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
For the main topics this week I have learnt about random walks, broadcast, diffusion, contagion and the markov processes. Later during the week I noticed the importance of these processes in the real life world such as businesses and can assist in preparing for the possible scenarios especially in terms of the stock market. In terms of random walk models I didn't know that it was even possible in calculating whether a drunk man would fall off the cliff or not. This week I also learnt about the Granovetter Threshold Theory which I had never heard about. It is a theory that assumes every individual have thresholds and when exceeded will have a certain reaction which can be calculated with probability.

### What insights have I gained?
What was eye openning for me this week is that the results gained in memory random walks is close to what happens in the NBA, NFL and etc. Furthermore what was interesting was the modelling of the riots, I could never imagine that these riots as a concept for the Granovetter Threshold Thoery and how it is due to the individuals exceeding their set thresholds.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Upon reflection, I have noticed fewer strengths than weakness. For my strength, I once again notice that when math is involved I feel a lot more confident and at ease. In this case it is the markov transition matrix multiplication. However, on the otherside although I may know the mathematics it does not matter if I cannot wrap my head around these concepts. Even after re-reading everything these concepts are still hard to fully understand and I will be needing more time til I am able to understand these naturally.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
During this week there was a lot more content than normal so in order to assist my understanding I decided to set aside more time for this subject so that I wouldn't fall behind. Although this did not completely solve my problem at hand it definitely helped to some degree.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For the future weeks I wwill look ahead into the future content of this subject so that I will be more prepared and ready. If there is a topic that is very content heavy for the week I will also try to search the web for more perspectives if needed.

## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week had a lot of heavy content and that I am very new to. The main topics of what I have learnt this week was segregation and peer effects, coordination and culture and social learning. No topic really took my interest besides the pure coordination game, it was rather interesting seeing how culture can be modelled. Something I did not know prior to this week was the natural characteristics of humans to be able to adapt and change their behaviour depending on what kind of situation they are in. Furthermore, a concept that I completely did not expect was the perspective of games theory and how culture can be modelled as pure coordination games. As a result the opinions of otheres will change the group producing a different outcome.I found out that things I believe could never be modelled could actually be modelled such as social learning from replicator dynamics. I didn't know that through psychology, economics and ecology you could model things such as learning, populations of people learning and evolution.

### What insights have I gained?
Schelling's segregation model has been a huge benefit in understanding the behaviours and characteristics of humans. I now know that humans will tend to follow a certain rule to form communities. This whole concept would make perfect sense as people with common interests will tend to group together and at the same time avert from those without any common interests.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
With the week 8 assignment due date coming up I have realised a major strength of mine is communication. Not only is it beneficial for me to always know what is going on within the group by being present but it is also beneficial for my members to know that I will always contactable at most times. However, a weakness that has still proven to exist for me is the inability to work on assignments until the due date closes in. If in my mind I believe I can complete the task eventually I will tend to wait til that time to start the task.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I had to face as said above is not being able to start on the assignment and work on it at a steady rate. A partial solution to this that ended up happening was guilt over seeing my group progress through their components of the task even though I myself haven't done much of my part of the assignment. However, as you can expect it is not a very healthy solution as it is out of my control and runs off guilt.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To do better for upcoming assignments, I will ask the team leader to set weekly goals for us to complete so that I will at least stay on track and not rely on the stress of the due date to control how I write my assignment.


## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week? What insights have I gained?
Throughout this week I have learnt about the two new concepts Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoners Dilemma. The Colonel Blotto Game is a strategy-based game in which has one winner and loser. There is no best strategy but the two opponents try to win as many battles as possible based on the resources of eachother. In terms of how it can relate to the real world, it is commonly seen in politics and sports. For the Prisoners Dilemma, it is based around cooperation. Each of the 'prisoners' rely on eachother to form a mutual agreement in order to achieve the best possible outcome for both parties. For example each 'prisoner' is presented with two options, to protect eachother by staying quiet (cooperation) or to confess and make the other sentenced for more jail time.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A key strength I was able to notice this week upon reflecting was the ability to relate the concepts of the Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoners Dilemma to real life scenarios. As this was the week where the assignment draft was due, a weakness I have noticed is the inability to use the Jupyter Notebook application. I was unable to complete the task probably and needed to rely on my group to help me apply my components into the github repository.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I had face was the struggles to adapt to applying my section onto the group repository on github. To assist me, my group leader had offered to help those in the group that did not know how to use Jupyter Notebook which eventually helped with clarity for the assignment. Before I had accidently corrupted the master file of the assignment in an attempt to add my component but luckily one of my group members had backed up the file which prevented any more potential harm that may cause the file to not open.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For next time I will not leave the assignment til the last day which eventually led to problems such as the lack of knowledge to use Jupyter Notebook as I did not have enough time to be able to fully understand the application before the assignment was due.


## Week 9

### What have I learnt this week?
From Week 9 and onwards there are no more new content to learn about. However, we were required to provide feedback to other groups and received feedback for my own group aswel. However, there was only one feedback sent to my group and it was not directed to me or any of my components. To assist in the upcoming group assignment I have started to learn more about github and the Jupyter Notebook application to feel more comfortable using it in the upcoming weeks.

### What insights have I gained?
An insight I was able to gain this week despite the lack of content was achieved whilst giving feedback to other groups' assignment; it was due to thinking from a reader's perspective that allowed me to realise what was important and missing from our own group's submission. Finding an issue from another group also proved to be useful for our own group as at the time we did not know of any potential upgrades for the assignment.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A core weakness of mine that still remains is the lack of knowledge regarding using Jupyter Notebook. Especially with the amount of weeks left for the assignment it was still hard for me to be committed to the assignment at hand as there was plenty of time left. However, I also noticed that a strength of mine is the willingness to help out a group member whenever they are in need. This has helped me and prevented me from falling behind as I would also need to know the contents to assist my fellow group members.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Similarly to week 9 a reoccuring issue I had to face was the lack of knowledge regarding how to use the systems like Jupyter Notebook. Another challenge that I had to face was the lack of motivation to keep working on with the assignment with plenty of time left for the assignment. To combat this, I had asked my group members to work together in an attempt to be eachothers motivation to keep working on.

## Week 10

### What have I learnt this week? What insights have I gained?
Much like week 9 there was no more content to be learnt but in this weeks workshop we were put into breakout rooms to work on the assignment. Whilst in a group we analysed what we had received as a group for the feedback of our draft assignment. This was when we gained insight on what to look out for for the future assignment; instead of just simply completing the task now we would analyse our product in different perspectives so that we would also be able to provide feedback for ourselves. Whether it was positive or negative it still provided valuable information that would be able to assist our assignment.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness of mine that I had noticed this week which related to last week's about the inability to wrap my head around Python was that my knowledge of Java prior to this subject would cause issues. Although it isn't directly affecting the results of my answers I am definitely using up a lot more time than necessary for this assignment. A strength of mine would be bonds with my fellow group members as I know that if I ask for assistance they would always be willing to help me as soon as possible.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I had to face this week was the trouble of importing visual images using Jupyter for our assignment. However this was quickly resolved by our team leader giving a quick demonstration to the group how to port the images using 'Imgur' which is website that can host the images to be used in our assignment.

## Week 11

### What have I learnt this week? What insights have I gained?
This week we learnt that the assignment got extended from the 23rd of October to the 6th of November. This will definitely give us more time to increase the quality of the report.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
There weren't any new strengths that I noticed this weak but in terms of weakness, it would still be the ability to work on my assignment efficiently with more than a week left til the due date. This was especially the case as the assignment had got extended aswel. Another remaining weakness is the lack of knowledge for using Python as it is still a new coding language for me.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
To further assist my problem in being unable to completely understand Python I had reached out to more individuals outside of my group that I used Python before so that they can teach me the essentials. I would then pass on this knowledge to my group memebers incase they were also unable to.


## Week 12

### What have I learnt this week?
In this final week, the class was cancelled but the tutor had offered 1 on 1 sessions in return to assist students with their assignments. However, my group and I were on track and did not need any further assistance.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
After learning more about Python from my friends outside of the course I realised that a strength of mine is the ability to learn quicker verbally rather than in text form. No further weaknesses were observed this week.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I observed was certain members of my group unable to use Python as well as other and to help combat this we assigned more group meetings to help eachother out where possible.
