## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
Learnt about the definitions and attributes of a system aswel as complex systems

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I didn't know the types of systems such as complex, complicated, chaotic and obvious systems.

### What insights have I gained?
I never knew that systems especially complex had a lot more depth to it as well as its steps within the characteristics of a complex system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I've noticed that when its a lot easier to learn about the different systems when they are compared against eachother. My weakness is that I tend to lose focus too easily half way in the workshop.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
It was hard to stay focused during class towards the end but communicating with my team during the workshop helped me stay on task as if they ask a question I want to be able to help them.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would need to remove all my distractions within my room so that I won't lose focus.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the uses of modelling and how they can help give us a better understanding of the problems of complex adaptive systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I did not know that all models are wrong and that many are useful.

### What insights have I gained?
That there are many different ways to use models in similar situations rather than one staple pathway. Since highschool I really enjoyed math because it was a subject that always just required to find the formula (pathway) and just plug the formula into the question but now I notice that subjects like 41189 aren't as simple and can have multiple answers.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My weakness is that when I see the topic as something I have learnt about before such as models I tend to get overly confident and zone out often but this always comes back to bite as it is a lot more complex than I imagined. My strength is acknowledging this bad behaviour and trying to learn from my mistake.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The only challenge I faced this week was to stay on track of the content but was easily fixed after my realisation for the depth of content.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To never underestimate a topic so that I won't fall behind on any topic

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the Shapely and LOTB value

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Rules of thumb often outperform the most sophisticated strategies

### What insights have I gained?
That there is numerical value when calculating an individual's value.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I noticed that when there are math formulas I feel more confident but at the same time if there is a new math symbol that I am unaware of it takes some time to wrap my head around it.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I struggled to understand what certain symbols meant in the Shapely value but it was quickly solved after asking my group members for help.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To do better next time I should look into next weeks topics beforehand so that I will have a general understanding before the workshop.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
I have learnt about system dynamics, networks and agent-based models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before I did not know about the 6 degrees of separation where we are only 6 steps away from any person across the world.

### What insights have I gained?
That there are not only so many different models that can be applied to certain scenarios but also that models have a lot more complexity and layers to it than meets the eye.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Through the videos and diagrams that I have seen it has definitely proven that I am a visual learner but at the same time the images can be misleading.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There were a few images that caused me confused but after asking my group I received an explanation that helped wrap my head around it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I should communicate with my group/class more so that I do not fall behind and understand the content at the time.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Probability distributions, normal distributions and long-tailed distributions

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
That probability distributions can help model our world allowing us to obtain estimates of the probability for certain events that may occur.

### What insights have I gained?
That long-tailed distributions should not be over-seen and have sufficient probability to be of concern.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness that has been reoccurring is my ability to use github, it has been a slow process learning how to navigate through the system.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There were no challenges I encountered this week

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I should pay attention more in class when the teacher is using github.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
I have learnt about random walks, broadcast, diffusion, contagion and the markov processes.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know how the markov convergence theorem works

### What insights have I gained?
That the results gained in memory random walks is close to what happens in the NBA, NFL and etc

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I once again notice that when math is involved I feel a lot more confident and at ease. In this case it is the markov transition matrix multiplication.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
There was a lot of content this week (more than normal) so I decided to set aside more time for this subject so that I wouldn't fall behind.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would look at ahead into the future content of this subject so that I will be more prepared and ready.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
N/A


## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week had a lot of heavy content and that I am very new to. The main topics of what I have learnt this week was segregation and peer effects, coordination and culture and social learning. No topic really took my interest besides the pure coordination game, it was rather interesting seeing how culture can be modelled.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I found out that things I believe could never be modelled could actually be modelled such as social learning from replicator dynamics. I didn't know that through psychology, economics and ecology you could model things such as learning, populations of people learning and evolution.
